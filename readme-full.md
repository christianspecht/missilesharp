MissileSharp will be a .NET library to control an USB Missile Launcher.

The first version will support only one model, the [Dream Cheeky Thunder](http://www.dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher), as this is the only one I own.  
*(I'm in Germany, and I bought [my missile launcher](http://www.getdigital.de/products/USB_Raketenwerfer) from a German Shop...but it seems to be the same model as the Dream Cheeky Thunder.)*
